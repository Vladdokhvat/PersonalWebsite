			<h4>Hello, I am Vladyslav, but to most I am known as Vlad. I was born in Ternopil, Ukraine where I spend first nine years of my life. At the age one nine, I moved to United States to live the American Dream. Growing up, technology was always my passion. As I grew older, my passion for tech grew bigger. In highschool, I took many classes focused in engineering. In college, I realized that engineering isn't for me. I attended Cumberland County College to pursue an associate's degreee in Computer Science. Next fall I will be attending Rutgers University with a major in IT, and minor in Buisness. My hobbies consist of coding, photography, design, travel, and fishing. My long term goal is to graduate college, and become a succesful developer.</h4>
